# wherdr

**Upgrading to 2.0.0?** Read the [release notes](docs/release-notes-2.0.0.md) for breaking changes and the 1.x migration checklist.

wherdr is an unofficial, self-hosted web client for [Herdr](https://herdr.dev).
Start coding agents on your computer, follow their work and reply from your phone or browser.
It uses the same Herdr session, with live conversations, real terminals and a herdr-projects Board.

## Quick start

On the Linux or macOS computer running **Herdr ≥ 0.9.1**, run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://wherdr.dev/install | sh
```

The installer checks prerequisites, offers Node.js 22 if needed, installs the Herdr plugin
and starts wherdr as your user at **http://localhost:7683**. It also configures automatic
startup: at login on macOS; at boot on Linux with lingering enabled, otherwise at login. The installer reports which case applies.
Open that address, or press **prefix+i** in Herdr, to follow the setup guide: agents, phone access
through Tailscale, optional passkey lock and notifications. See [first launch](docs/quick-start.md).

Prefer help from your coding agent? Paste:

```text
Read https://wherdr.dev/agent.md and help me set up wherdr. Check what is already installed first, and ask me before installing anything.
```

**wherdr is a remote shell as your user.** Keep it on localhost or a private network such as
Tailscale; never expose it to the public Internet. Read [Security](docs/security.md) before remote access.
