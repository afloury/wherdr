// omp: only its free-answer field takes typed text; its select dialog (tool
// approval) or "Ask" list would lose it, and Enter would answer them in the
// user's place.
// Codex stopped by its update, or just gone (`leaving`): a shell. The server
// holds the message; typed with Enter it would run as a command.
